# kx86
an imperative, modular programming language to make x86 kernel development easy
# how it works
kx86 programs compile to a kernel which is then combined with a bootloader to make an os image
# stack
the functionality is written in x86 assembly and the parser is written in py3 (ill port the parser to C eventually)
